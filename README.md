Hello! This project is a website formatted as a desk to introduce my hobbies through images of objects related to each. Originally, I saw this idea on instagram and thought it would be cool to recreate it myself! There are a couple things I wished I added and spent more time on but I am hoping to move on to another project (keep that in mind while you are looking through...) I made this on VS code using HTML/CSS. Hope you enjoy! 

Features 
- Carousel
- Animation
